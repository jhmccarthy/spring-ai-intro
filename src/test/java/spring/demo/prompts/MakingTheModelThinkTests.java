            In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on
            a quest to fetch water from a hilltop well.

            struckâ€”Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled
            down the hill, with Jill following suit.
            Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to
            comforting embraces. Despite the mishap,
            their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they

            To solve the problem do the following:
            - First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total.
            - Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not.
